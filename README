***********************************************************************
I stopped playing FFXI (in February 2015) so I may not be able to help
with bugs but I'll try... So long as you can give me more information
then "it doesn't work"
***********************************************************************

With this addon loaded, just click on any brown treasure casket and it
will display info about possible combinations, the best number to guess
and the worst case chance of guessing correctly.
